            <h2>THE WHITECHAPEL HORROR: A SERIES OF GRUESOME MURDERS</h2>
            <p><b>LONDON, <span class="sang">Mar<span class="game-letter">c</span>h</span> 30.</b> — Fear grips the
                streets of Whitechapel as yet another body has been discovered, marking the fourth such brutal slaying
                in recent weeks. The latest victim, a woman of middle years, was found in an alleyway behind Commercial
                Street, her throat cruelly slashed. The police remain baffled, and speculation abounds that the killer,
                whom the public has begun calling "The Phantom of Whitechapel," is no common criminal, but a fiend of
                unspeakable cunning.</p>
            <p>Inspector Lestrade of <span class="sang">Sc<span class="game-letter">o</span>tland</span> Yard has
                assured the public that every measure is being taken to apprehend the perpetrator, though no suspect has
                yet been identified. In a turn of great intrigue, it has been confirmed that the renowned detective Mr.
                Sherlock Holmes has taken interest in the case. "There is a singular pattern to these atrocities,"
                remarked Holmes when approached outside 221B Baker Street, "and I intend to uncover it before the
                villain strikes again."</p>
            <p>Residents of the area have taken to locking their door before dusk, while whispers of conspiracy and dark
                doings grow ever louder. Will Mr. Holmes succeed where the Yard has thus far faltered? The city waits in
                anxious anticipation.</p>
